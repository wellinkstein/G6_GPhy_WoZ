There is only one player, he begins with a set of defined attributes (health points,
damage, protection, ...).
The labyrinth is viewed from above and the player sees only the spot next to the one he is in.
When he progresses in the labyrinth, spot after spot, he will meet monsters and fight
them in order to obtain legendary items.
With these items, he will be able to defeat the boss and exit the labyrinth.
He will also find more common items, like shields, armors, swords in different spots
to help him fight the easiest monsters.

Combat:
When the player enters a room with a monster in it, he will have the choice to attack
or run away and go back to the previous room.
If he chooses to fight, the combat starts. The character has a 50/50 chance to attack first,
or 100/100 when he has "Herme's shoes".
Each character attacks one after the other until when of them dies, ie their health points
reaches 0.

If the player dies, it's over.
If the monster dies, he will drop a legendary item that the player can get.
