Welcome to Daedalus

Daedalus is a project created by Master 1 students studying in physiological, biotechnological, and computer science enginnering
Please read the following text to understand how to play our game.

In this game you are Theseus, you were selected as a sacrifice to the mighty Minotaur, you of course have no intention of dying here.
Your mission is to exit the labyrinth, but before hand, you must slay the Minotaur to prevent the loss of other innocent souls.

On this quest you may encounter the vicious monsters inhabitting this labyrinth.
Slaying monsters on your own is impossible, you will require items to do so. Items can be found throughout the labyrinth.
If you are successfull in killing a monster, you will be rewarded with legendary loot which will further help you on your quest.

Theseus is capable of carrying up to 10 items, items can be picked up when found and dropped at any time on the condition of not being in a fight
Dropped items will remain in the area in which they were dropped. Among these items there are health potions.
However keep in mind that theseus has a maximum of 20 hp, thus health potions cannot be used to go above that value.

This game works in a scrolling fashion to properly represent the feeling of being in a labyrinth, as the player you will only be able to see
what is in your vacinity, not beyond.
Furthermore, there is no map to the labyrinth, it will be your job to remember which passages are correct and which are dead ends.

The game will assist you by warning you when you are about to encounter a monster, at which point you may decided to fight it or run away and return
at a later time.

As previously stated, throughout the labyrinth you will encounter monsters, there are six monsters in total (including the minotaur). Each monster is different
and may thus be easier or harder to kill.

Good luck on your quest

Yours truly, Group 6 of COO-POO
